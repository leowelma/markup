## Lecture Week 5

This week has no lecture slides. We discuss the flow of creating a website with `Git`, `Quarto` and `GitHub pages`. 
:::

What follows is an exercise that will help you set up your own website. Some of the steps can be confusing and/or complicated. When in doubt, you can consult [my website](https://pablomosuu.github.io/), which is served by [this repository](https://github.com/PabloMosUU/pablomosuu.github.io).

## Exercise

Do the following:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub called `yourname.github.io`, where `yourname` is your GitHub username.
    - Select the option "Add README"
    - Select the option "Add license". I suggest you choose "GNU General Public License v3.0".
2. Build a website using `Quarto` and [`GitHub pages`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) that showcases your work. You may include, e.g.,

    - who you are
    - what you do (e.g. expertise, service, product)
    - where people may find you (GitHub, company page, Facebook, X, etc.)
    - accomplishments/publications/qualifications/skills etc.
    - detailed curriculum vitae

3. Add a link to your website to the `README.md` file of your repository.
4. Make your website into a `GitHub` template
5. Hand in the link to your hosted personal website as well as a link to your template on `GitHub` - they are deliverables for this course. Also add a zip of the repo at the time of handing in - on your `GitHub` repo click the green `Code` button and choose `Download ZIP`.

### Alternative

If you already know how to build a webpage with any other means, you can also use that. The goal is to have a webpage as a developer portfolio that showcases you and your work. Still, you need to hand in the link to a working web-page, a template on `GitHub` and an archive (on `GitHub` click the green `code` button and `Download ZIP`) of your site at the time of handing it in.

### Custom domain

If you want to use a custom domain name, you need to buy one. You can do this on many websites. To use a custom domain with Github pages, you need to add a `CNAME` file to your repository. You can read more about this [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). After addition of the `CNAME`, your website will be available at the custom domain. For example, where Gerko Vink's website is available at [https://gerkovink.github.io](https://gerkovink.github.io), he can also access it at [https://www.gerkovink.com](https://www.gerkovink.com). Any repository converted to a `GitHub` pages website (such as this course webpage) will then not only be available at `https://username.github.io/repositoryname`, but also at and `https://www.customdomain.com/repositoryname`. 

### Render on `push to main`
If you'd like your site to render when you push changes to the `main` branch, you must 

1. create a file called `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml`
2. add [these contents](https://github.com/PabloMosUU/pablomosuu.github.io/blob/599b1ad74c3edd69d9045907ba4b2b243b37676d/.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml) to the file
3. go to Settings, then select Pages on the left-hand side, and under "Build and deployment" select "GitHub Actions"

`GitHub` will automatically deploy webpages with an action.


## Further reading

All details to set this up smoothly can be found in the [Quarto GitHub pages documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html). More information about building websites with `Quarto` can be found in the [Quarto websites documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

## Safe and compliant cloud storage
If you need some secure (GDPR or HIPAA compliant) file sharing, open up a free 5GB account on [Sync.com](https://www.sync.com/?_sync_refer=d609f9a50). If you use [this link](https://www.sync.com/?_sync_refer=d609f9a50) you'll get a free additional 1GB - so 6GB of super-secure storage. Don't lose your 2FA recovery keys, though!

## Nothing to show for?
Have a look at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). It is a yearly event where you can solve programming puzzles. You can use any language you like. It is a great way to learn a new language or to practice your skills. Plus you can use your solutions as a portfolio.
